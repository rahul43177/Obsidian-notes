The main difference between a library and a framework is ==how control is handled over the application flow==:

- **Library**
    
    The developer controls the flow of the application, calling functions from the library when needed. Libraries are collections of functions that developers can use to speed up the development process.
    
- **Framework**
    
    The framework controls the flow of the application, calling functions from the developer's code. Frameworks are like blueprints for building an application, and the developer must follow the framework's rules. 
    

Here are some other differences between libraries and frameworks:

- **Extensibility**
    
    Frameworks are designed to be extended, while libraries offer specific functionality without facilitating extensibility. 
    

- **Code organization**
    
    Frameworks dictate the structure of the application, while developers have more freedom in organizing their code with libraries. 
    

- **Level of abstraction**
    
    Frameworks provide a higher level of abstraction, while libraries offer specific functionality at a lower level. 
    

- **Ease of incorporation**
    
    Libraries can be easily linked into existing programs, while frameworks are difficult to incorporate seamlessly into an existing project. 
    

The distinction between libraries and frameworks isn't always clear-cut, and some tools may exhibit characteristics of both
