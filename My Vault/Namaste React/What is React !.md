React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.Â Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:

What it does:

- **Builds UIs:**
    
    React helps you create interactive and dynamic user interfaces for web applications.
    
- **Component-based:**
    
    React encourages breaking down your UI into reusable components, making your code more organized and maintainable.
    
- **Declarative style:**
    
    You describe how your UI should look based on its state, and React takes care of updating the DOM efficiently.
    
- **Virtual DOM:**
    
    React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to optimize updates, leading to better performance.
